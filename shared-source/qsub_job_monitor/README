To download for use, select the "gwas_winners_curse-1.0.tar.gz" file.

Many bugs no doubt exist in this BETA release.  Please send
descriptions of bugs, with sample code invocation as appropriate,
to <cdp2130@cumc.columbia.edu>

zlib and libbz2 are highly recommended but not strictly required. If included
through ./configure, this will enable files processed by gwc
to be compressed, as long as the filenames terminate in ".gz" or ".bz2"

More information to come as this software approaches maturation.
./gwas_winners_curse.out --help lists many available options and descriptions.
